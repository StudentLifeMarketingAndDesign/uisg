First, we will discuss a framework called SybilBelief that we developed to detect fake ( also called Sybil) accounts in online social networks. The SybilBelief framework models a social network as a pairwise Markov Random Fields and uses Loopy Belief Propagation to infer the labels (i.e., benign or fake) of accounts.
