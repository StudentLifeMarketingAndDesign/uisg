He finds it not to be so, and when he becomes infatuated with a beautiful and witty sophisticate, he becomes desperate to win her attention. As the novel progresses, morals begin to blur, and neither character is who they seem to be.\n\n“Like a novel of manners distorted by a twisted funhouse mirror, Teddy Wayne’s Loner moves with wit and stealth and merciless deliberation towards increasingly brutal psychic terrain. Reading it, I found myself amused and then—with creeping force—afraid, repulsed, and ultimately unwilling to put it down.\" —Leslie Jamison\n\nTeddy Wayne is the winner of a Whiting Writers’ Award and an NEA Fellowship, as well as a finalist for the Young Lions Fiction Award, PEN/Bingham Prize, and Dayton Literary Peace Prize. He writes regularly for The New Yorker, The New York Times, Vanity Fair, and McSweeney’s.

He finds it not to be so, and when he becomes infatuated with&nbsp;a beautiful and witty sophisticate, he becomes desperate to win her attention. As the novel progresses, morals begin to blur, and neither character is who they seem to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Like a novel of manners distorted by a twisted funhouse mirror, Teddy Wayne&rsquo;s <i>Loner</i> moves with wit and stealth and merciless deliberation towards increasingly brutal psychic terrain. Reading it, I found myself amused and then&mdash;with creeping force&mdash;afraid, repulsed, and ultimately unwilling to put it down.&quot; &mdash;Leslie Jamison</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teddy Wayne is the winner of a Whiting Writers&rsquo; Award and an NEA Fellowship, as well as a finalist for the Young Lions Fiction Award, PEN/Bingham Prize, and Dayton Literary Peace Prize.

Her trademark has always been to write about the human cost of war, to attempt to give war a human face, and to work in conflict zones that the world&#39;s press has forgotten.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the beginning of the Arab Spring, di Giovanni has mainly been focused in the Middle East, a region she has been working in for two decades. She travels extensively to Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and Syria to do field work and research. Her concentration has been on the war in Syria, and her new book,&nbsp;<i>The Morning They Came for Us: Dispatches from Syria</i>, was published in 2016&nbsp;by W.W. Norton as well as Bloomsbury in the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her other books include<i>&nbsp;Ghosts by Daylight: A Memoir of War and Love;&nbsp;The Place at the End of the World: Essays from the Edge;</i><i>&nbsp;Against the Stranger, </i>about the effect of occupations during the first intifada on both Palestinians and Israelis; and&nbsp;<i>The Quick and The Dead, </i>about the siege of Sarajevo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She has consulted with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on the Syrian refugee crisis, writing a major advocacy report on the future of women refugees in July 2014, and was part of a team that wrote a report on the future of Syria&rsquo;s refugee children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Middle East Editor of&nbsp;<i>Newsweek</i>&nbsp;and contributing editor of&nbsp;<i>Vanity Fair</i>,&nbsp;she recently became an Ochberg Fellow at Columbia University in recognition of her work on violence and war and the trauma it brings to society, and has been named as one of the 100 most influential people reducing armed conflict by Action on Armed Violence (AOAV). She is also an Associate Fellow at the Geneva Center for Policy Studies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals with disabilities are encouraged to attend all University of Iowa sponsored events.
