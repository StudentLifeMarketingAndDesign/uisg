No problem. We’ll have a small, curated collection of books and materials that you can explore. Don’t feel like chatting? That’s fine too.

Events during the month of April will focus on social justice activism and the environment.\n\nWe’ll host a special discussion on March 8 that focuses on Angela Davis’ most recent works in preparation for her lecture later that evening. The first ten students who drop by to discuss Davis’ work will receive a UI Libraries Iowa Women’s Archives t-shirt.\n\nEach week we’ll feature materials from our #readforjustice collection. The collection is designed to encourage interactions between multiple users and one book. As you engage with the book, leave notes in the margins, highlight passages that excite you, dog-ear pages that you want other people not to miss, leave a question left unanswered by your reading—do whatever it is you are compelled to do while reading this book. If you’re up for it, post a picture of yourself with the book to your social media account and make sure to include the #readforjustice hashtag.

This talk is based on the book they wrote, <b><a href=\"http://www.uiowapress.org/books/2015-spring/dubuques-forgotten-cemetery.htm\"><i>Dubuque&#39;s Forgotten Cemetery: Excavating a Nineteenth-century Burial Ground in a Twenty-first-century City</i></a></b>, published by the University of Iowa Press in March 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Robin and Jennifer will unravel myths and history of the cemetery and talk about the analysis of the human skeletal remains, which gives us a picture of life and death for Iowa&#39;s early Euroamerican settlers. They will describe the dig, the analysis, and the rigorous archival research that took place to restore the stories of the people buried there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://sanfordmuseum.org/nwias.htm\">Northwest Chapter of the Iowa Archeological Society</a> meets on the first Wednesday of every month at 6 p.m. In addition to discussing upcoming events, these monthly meetings feature special activities, field trips, or presentations. These meetings are open to the public, so feel free to bring a friend!</p>\r\n","featured":false,"geo":{"latitude":"42.750222","longitude":"-95.550386","street":"117 East Willow Street","city":"Cherokee","state":"IA","country":"US","zip":"51012"},"filters":{"departments":[{"name":"Research & Economic Development","id":32506},{"name":"Discover Research","id":32507},{"name":"Office of the State Archaeologist","id":36944}],"event_audience":[{"name":"Everybody","id":33630}],"event_general_interest":[{"name":"Arts Iowa","id":33507},{"name":"Museums","id":33512},{"name":"Outreach Iowa","id":43014},{"name":"STEM","id":43015}],"event_types":[{"name":"Meeting","id":32585},{"name":"Community Event","id":33741},{"name":"Information Session","id":33744},{"name":"Guest Speaker","id":36899}]},"custom_fields":{"contact_name":"Megan Stroh","contact_email":"archaeologist@sanfordmuseum.org"},"localist_url":"http://events.uiowa.edu/event/bone_where_theres_not_supposed_to_be_any","photo_url":"http://images-cf.localist.com/photos/353761/huge/0ed18894f3e01d059e1d357f84183eb206b76854.jpg","venue_url":null}},{"event":{"event_instances":[{"event_instance":{"id":1858896,"ranking":0,"event_id":629517,"start":"2016-04-06T18:00:00-05:00","end":null,"all_day":false}}],"id":629517,"title":"Live from Prairie Lights: Mark Levine and Robyn Schiff","url":"http://www.prairielights.com/live","updated_at":"2016-04-05T06:18:48-05:00","created_at":"2016-02-24T10:52:54-06:00","facebook_id":null,"first_date":"2016-04-06","last_date":"2016-04-06","hashtag":null,"urlname":"live_from_prairie_lights_mark_levine_and_robyn_schiff","user_id":123414,"directions":"","allows_reviews":true,"allows_attendance":true,"location":"","room_number":"","location_name":"Prairie Lights Bookstore","created_by":123414,"updated_by":123414,"city_id":null,"neighborhood_id":null,"school_id":92,"campus_id":null,"recurring":false,"free":true,"private":false,"verified":true,"rejected":false,"sponsored":false,"venue_id":119016,"ticket_url":"","ticket_cost":"","keywords":[],"tags":[],"description_text":"Nationally acclaimed Iowa City Poets Robyn Schiff and Mark Levine will read from their highly anticipated new books at Prairie Lights Books.
