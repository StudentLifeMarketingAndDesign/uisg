The curriculum has strong connections with the National Coalition Building Institute (NCBI) model and other leadership-development experiences. The MY IOWA experience extends well beyond the retreat itself. Participants continue to stay connected to campus resources, administrators, and fellow students, building upon the relationships they form at the retreat.\n\nThe registration deadline is Friday, September 23, 2016.
